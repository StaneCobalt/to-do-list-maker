# todoList
A daily to-do list that selects a random photo for the background. (all photos come from unsplash)
Uses taffyDB to store copies of your list.
TaffyDB uses LocalStorage to store data and requires 3rd party cookies to be enabled on your browser in order to work.
This program will run without cookies, you just won't be able to save your list.

This isn't meant to be used for keeping a comprehensive to-do list. The mindset behind this program is to focus only on a few things a day, and try your best to accomplish them.
